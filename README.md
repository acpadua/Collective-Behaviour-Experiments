# Repository for the Collective bahaviour experiments of Free Swimming:
## A Comparison of group behaviour in two species: Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Giant danio

The jupyter notebooks in this folder contain data analysis of animal trajectories obtained with the software for tracking animals in a group - idtrackerai.
The trajectories of all animals in each group were obtained from the videos recorded in laboratory conditions.
Experimental conditions, as well as data analysis pipeline are described in the notebooks below. 

<strong>Experiment dates:</strong>

* April 2022: Free Swimming experiment with Danio rerio (N=15)
* May 2022: Free Swimming experiment with Giant danio (N=5)
* 2019: Ontogeny experiment with Danio rerio (N=4)

N - total number of fish in the group
